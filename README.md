# Media Provider

It is a project that manage the storage of media assets like images and documents so it can be use later on. The project shows all the assets uploaded in a preview section. User can create folder structures to organize their assets.
All the assets will be stored in a Github repository and the folder structure and assets category will be manage by a CMS.

## Development technologies

In this project I used the following main technologies:

- Strapi CMS
- NextJS
- Octokit
- Github API

## How to run the project

This project is totally decouple, each folders has its own setup readme with the details to run it.
This is because in case you just want to run one of them you just have to setup the one that you want, otherwise read both readme setup and work with it.
